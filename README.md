# NSCLC

This contains the code and data to generate the key results in the paper: Nair et al., "A landscape of response to drug combinations in non-small cell lung cancer", Nature Communications, 2023. 

Download the compressed folder https://hpc.nih.gov/~Lab_ruppin/NSCLC_code_manuscript.zip and uncompress (unzip) it. This folder contains the data for generating the figures. 

Download the R file "code_paper_naturecomm_Jan2023.R" from Github and store it in the NSCLC_code_manuscript folder. 

Run the code_paper_naturecomm_Jan2023.R code to generate the key analysis that are a part of the Nair et al. paper titled "A landscape of response to drug combinations in non-small cell lung cancer". There are many files in "NSCLC_code_manuscript" which are either used as input or output for the code code_paper_naturecomm_Jan2023.R. 

We note that some of the main figures were generated using software such as Tableau and Cytoscape, and we do not have the code for it. In such cases, we provided code for generating many of the input files that could help while using any such software packages.
